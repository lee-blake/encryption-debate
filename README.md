# The Encryption Debate
This is a short project illustrating the challenges of regulating encryption. It is part of CS239: Social and Professional Issues

## Play the game
You can access the game [here](https://lee-blake.github.io/encryption-debate/).

## Motivation
This game covers the basics of encryption and some of the more common proposals to regulate it. It also covers some bad ideas to illustrate why we have arrived at the proposals we have now. A basic introduction to encryption is included with the game as a way to make it at least somewhat accessible on its own to a general audience. 

The intention of this game is to cover the difficulties in making good ethical decision making in regulation of computing technology. It covers cases where analog solutions are good ideas (creating consistent privacy conditions), as well as cases where they are not good ideas (master keys for law enforcement). Such examples serve to show both how the way we approach regulation of technology needs to be informed by the technology itself, as well has how we can use past solutions to problems from other domains to tackle future challenges with technology. Additionally, this game is intended to teach the player the importance of engaging with opposing points of view to discover the potential consequences of their actions. Many of the negative choices have their consequences illustrated before the player makes the choice via arguments that the opposing side would present in a debate. Since correctly applying solutions to technology and considering the consequences of one's actions are some of the biggest issues in the ethics of technology today, my hope is that this game help people to be come more reflective on the ethical consequences of their choices.
